### 16-bit-ALU

This document describes the core and additional functions that we have created for our 16-bit-ALU, as part of our 50.002 Computation Structures module.

The core functions and corresponding testers include:
1. Adder/Subtracter
2. Boolean
3. Compare
4. Shifter
5. Multiplier

The additional functions and their testers include:
1. Divider
2. Modulo 
(the above two functions are nested within the adder module)
3. Factorial

Test Cases:
Account for the different operations (different opcode) and for the different cases of arithmetic with known values.
